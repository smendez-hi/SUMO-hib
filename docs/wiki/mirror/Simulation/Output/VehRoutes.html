			<p>The vehicle routes output contains information about which route a vehicle took and if his route was replaced at any time by a new one, each of the previous routes together with the edge at the time their replacement took place is reported. Furthermore, the times the vehicle has entered and has left the network are stored herein.
</p><p>In normal conditions, when all vehicles use predefined routes, the output does not contain any information that could not be retrieved from the routes and the tripinfo output. But as soon as you reroute your vehicles within the simulation, f.e. using rerouters, it will contain new information.

<p>Both the previous and the final routes are complete, that means that they contain all the edges the vehicle was meant to pass as long as the route was not replaced, yet. The information replacedOnEdge and replacedAtTime are available only for routes which were replaced.
