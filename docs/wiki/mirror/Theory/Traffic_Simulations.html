<p>In traffic research, four classes of traffic flow models are distinguished according to the
level of detail of the simulation. In <i>macroscopic</i> models traffic flow is the basic entity.
<i>Microscopic</i> models simulate the movement of every single vehicle on the street, mostly assuming
that the behaviour of the vehicle depends on both, the vehicle's physical abilities to move
and the driver's controlling behaviour (see <a href="../Publications.html#ChowdhurySantenSchadschneider2000" title="Publications">ChowdhurySantenSchadschneider2000</a>). Within
SUMO, the microscopic model developed by Stefan Krau√ü is used (see <a href="../Publications.html#Krauss1998_1" title="Publications">Krauss1998_1</a>, <a href="../Publications.html#Krauss1998_2" title="Publications">Krauss1998_2</a>), extended by some further assumptions. <i>Mesoscopic</i> simulations are located at the boundary between microscopic and
macroscopic simulations. Herein, vehicle movement is mostly simulated using queue approaches
and single vehicles are moved between such queues. <i>Sub-microscopic</i> models regard single vehicles
like microscopic, but extend them by dividing them into further substructures, which describe the
engine's rotation speed in relation to the vehicle's speed or the driver's preferred gear switching actions, for instance. This allows more detailed computations compared to simple microscopic simulations.
However, sub-microscopic models require longer computation times. This restrains the size of the
networks to be simulated.

</p><p>Within a <i>space-continuous</i> simulation each vehicle has a certain position described by a floating-point
number. In contrast, <i>space-discrete</i> simulations are cellular automata. They divide streets into cells and vehicles driving on the simulated streets "jump" from one cell to another.

</p><p><b>Figure: The difference between a space-continuous (top) and a space-discrete (bottom) simulation</b>
</p><p>Almost every simulation package uses its own model for vehicle movement. Almost all models are
so-called <i>"car-following-models"</i>: the behaviour of the driver is herein meant to be dependent on his
distance to the vehicle in front of him and of this leading vehicle's speed.

<a name="User_Assignment" id="User_Assignment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">User Assignment</span></h2>
<p>It seems obvious, that each driver is trying to use to shortest path through the network. But when all are
trying to do this, some of the roads - mainly the arterial roads - would get congested reducing the benefit
of using them. Solutions for this problem are known to traffic research as <i>user assignment</i>.
For solving this, several approaches are available and SUMO uses the <i>dynamic user assignment</i> (DUA) approach developed by Christian Gawron (see <a href="../Publications.html#Gawron1998_1" title="Publications">Gawron1998_1</a>).
