			<p>This document focuses on the main parts of a traffic simulation, that is streets (edges) including lanes, junctions (nodes), and vehicles with their routes. It contains nothing about traffic lights, detectors, visualization or stuff like that.
On the other hand this document aims at a precise description which serves as a template for implementation as well as for an xml schema for the input files. Therefore there is a table for all allowed attributes together with their type (and possibly unit). If the attribute is not mandatory, a default value is defined as well. The names of all elements and attributes consist of letters (lowercase or camelCaps) and underscores only. Keep in mind that the values of attributes which are ids should consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, hyphens, points and colons only, starting with a letter or an underscore (this is called "valid XML id" in the following). There are "follow-ups" to this document on the <a href="Specification/Persons.html" title="Specification/Persons">simulation of persons and multi-modality</a>
and on <a href="Specification/Duarouter.html" title="Specification/Duarouter">routing</a>.

<p>A single vehicle is not modeled, it is always the vehicle on a journey, that means once a vehicle has reached its destination it is deleted from the system and cannot be referenced any longer. The physical parameters of the vehicle are defined with its type, which also defines its membership in some vehicle categories. A vehicle is defined by the combination of its type and its route, together with parameters specifying the start and end behavior. Additional parameters such as color only serve visualization purposes. A vehicle can have routes and stops as child elements.

<p>At most one of "vehsPerHour" and "period" has to be given. If one of them is given it is not allowed to define "period" and "end".
The vehicles are equally distributed in the time interval. The number of vehicles emitted (if "no" is not given) is equal to ("end"-"begin")/"period" rounded to the nearest integer, thus if "period" is small enough, there might be no vehicle at all. Furthermore "period"=3600/"vehsPerHour". The first vehicle (if any) is always created at time "begin". The id of the created vehicles is "flowId.runningNumber".
</p>
<a name="Types" id="Types"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Types</span></h3>
<p>Types define physical parameters such as length, acceleration, deceleration and maximum speed and give a list of categories cars of this type belong to.
All theses parameters are identical among all vehicles of a type.

All vehicle type childs maybe referenced outside the distribution as well. The sum of the probabilities of the childs should be larger than zero.

<p>Streets need a unique id, a starting node and an ending node. Since the nodes are embedded into the plane, the length is optional and (if not given) is calculated as the euclidean distance between starting node and end node. There may be further points in the plane (no junctions) given to describe the shape of the street respectively calculating its length as the cumulative distance. The length has to be strictly positive (not zero). This means that if starting node and end node are identical, the length has either to be given explicitly or there needs to be at least one shape node at a position different from the start/end node. Optionally a number of lanes may be given (defaulting to 1, respectively to the number of lane elements in the definition of the street). If the number of lanes given as an attribute is smaller than the number of lane child elements this is an error. All parameters which can be given to lanes can also be given to the street and serve as a default for the corresponding lane parameter. The maximum speed allowed on the edge is given in m/s.

<p>If "duration" <i>and</i> "until" are given, the vehicle will stop for at least "duration" seconds. If "duration" is 0 the vehicle will decelerate such that it may in principle reach velocity 0 but instead of braking to full stop it will start to accelerate again.
If "until" is given and "duration" is not and the vehicle arrives at the stop at or after the time step defined by "until" it will not even decelerate. If until is defined in the context of a repeated vehicle insertion (flow) it will be incremented by the difference of vehicle creation time and "begin" of the flow.

<a name="Before_start" id="Before_start"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Before start</span></h3>
<p>On route loading (which is not necessarily the same as application startup) Sumo checks the route for connectivity and for proper placement of stops. On vehicle loading it also checks whether the vehicle is allowed to drive on all edges of its route and whether all other parameters are in the allowed ranges. If any violation of parameter ranges occurs, the simulation stops immediately with an error message. (It is still in discussion whether it should be possible to disable some of the checks via a command-line option, resulting in a vehicle which stops at the end of the last "valid" edge.)
</p>
<a name="Departure" id="Departure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Departure</span></h3>
<p>At the given departure time the simulation tries to insert the vehicle with the given parameters. If this is not possible because it would result in a collision, the simulation retries in the next simulation step. If "free" or "random" are specified for startpos and/or startlane, they are recalculated for the next try. The parameters are evaluated in the following order:
</p>
<ol><li> Determination of the lane
</li><li> Determination of the position (even if lane and position are both set to "free", we <i>do not</i> choose a different lane if we cannot find a free position on the lane chosen)
</li><li> Determination of the start speed (if position is "free" and speed is "max" we <i>do not</i> choose the position where we can reach the highest speed but choose the highest speed we can use at the position chosen before).
</li></ol>
<p>When determining the maximum speed and the possibility of insertion the next vehicle(s) upstream and the next vehicle(s) downstream have to be respected even if they are located on the next road section. Thus it may be necessary to take all road sections into account which lead into or follow the current section.
</p><p>For filling the simulation as fast as possible with vehicles, use the following parameters for the vehicle: <code>depart="0" departSpeed="0" departLane="free" departPos="random_free" period="0" number="100"</code>. Thus, 101 vehicles will be emitted at timestep 0 on the first edge of the given route.
</p>
<a name="Driving" id="Driving"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Driving</span></h3>
<p>At each step the model calculates a new target speed and accelerates (decelerates) the vehicle accordingly.
The acceleration is constant for the step such that a car which is at position s with speed v
and gets during the step an acceleration of a has after a timestep of length t the new position
s' = s + v*t + a*t^2/2 and v' = v + a*t.
</p>
<a name="Stops_2" id="Stops_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stops</span></h3>
<p>A vehicle tries to reach the most downstream position of a stop area before it actually stops. It can only be forced to stop earlier by other vehicles blocking the rest of the stop area. The duration of the stop starts counting with the first step in which the vehicle's position is in the stop area and its speed is 0. That means if a vehicle stops at timestep 10 (reaches the area and speed 0) and has a stop duration of 2, it stays there for step 11 and 12 and has a new speed and position in step 13 (provided no other blocking occurs).
</p>
<a name="End" id="End"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">End</span></h3>
<p>If the vehicle reaches the point of final destination it is removed from the simulation.
That means if the s' as calculated above is larger or equal to the destination point, the vehicle gets removed in this step.
