<p>A lane area detector is defined the following way within an additional file:
</p>
<div class="inlxml">&lt;laneAreaDetector id="&lt;ID&gt;" lane="&lt;LANE_ID&gt;" pos="&lt;POSITION_ON_LANE&gt;" length="&lt;DETECTOR_LENGTH&gt;" freq="&lt;AGGREGATION_TIME&gt;" file="&lt;OUTPUT_FILE&gt;" [cont="&lt;BOOL&gt;"] [timeThreshold="&lt;FLOAT&gt;"] [speedThreshold="&lt;FLOAT&gt;"] [jamThreshold="&lt;FLOAT&gt;"] [friendlyPos="x"]/&gt;</div>
<p>Most of the attributes have the same meaning as for <a href="../../Simulation/Output/Induction_Loops_Detectors_(E1).html" title="Simulation/Output/Induction Loops Detectors (E1)">induction loops</a>. As an areal detector has a certain length, "<span class="inlxml">length</span>" must be supplied as a further parameter. It may be a negative number which lets the detector be extended upstream to the given beginning position. The optional parameter "<span class="inlxml">cont</span>" let's the detector continue over the current lane onto this lane's predecessors when the detector's length plus his position is larger than the place available on the lane.

<p>A single data line within the output of a simulated lane area detector looks as following (the line is not broken within the output): <span class="inlxml">&lt;interval begin="&lt;BEGIN_TIME&gt;" end="&lt;END_TIME&gt;" id="&lt;DETECTOR_ID&gt;" nSamples="&lt;DATA_SAMPLES&gt;" meanSpeed="&lt;MEAN_SPEED&gt;" meanOccupancy="&lt;MEAN_OCCUPANCY&gt;" maxOccupancy="&lt;MAX_OCCUPANCY&gt;" meanMaxJamLengthInVehicles="&lt;VAL&gt;" meanMaxJamLengthInMeters="&lt;VAL&gt;" maxJamLengthInVehicles="&lt;VAL&gt;" maxJamLengthInMeters="&lt;VAL&gt;" jamLengthInVehiclesSum="&lt;VAL&gt;" jamLengthInMetersSum="&lt;VAL&gt;" meanHaltingDuration="&lt;VAL&gt;" maxHaltingDuration="&lt;VAL&gt;" haltingDurationSum="&lt;VAL&gt;" meanIntervalHaltingDuration="&lt;VAL&gt;" maxIntervalHaltingDuration="&lt;VAL&gt;" intervalHaltingDurationSum="&lt;VAL&gt;" startedHalts="&lt;VAL&gt;" meanVehicleNumber="&lt;VAL&gt;" maxVehicleNumber="&lt;VAL&gt;" /&gt;</span>
</p><p>To explain this vast amount of measures, a short note about how a lane area detector works is needfull. A lane area detector takes note about each vehicle that enters the area. As long as the vehicle does not leave the area completely, its state is collected in each time step during the interval. Each vehicle state in this case is called a "data sample" and the output of a lane area detector is made up from all data samples of all vehicles within the are during the complete data collection ("freq") interval.
</p><p>As a lane area detector covers a lane and vehicles are sorted on these, it is possible to recognize jams along the detector's area and measure them. Because more than one jam may take place at the area at one time, the values cover as well averaged measures of all jams ("jamLengthIn...Sum") as explicite measures of the longest (maximum) jam. For the longest jam, both averaged ("meanMaxJamLengthIn...") and maximum ("maxJamLengthIn...") values are written.
[Note]	Note
</p><p>The jam length in meters may be more than a sum of the vehicles lengths, because the place between vehicle is also taken into account.
</p><p>Besides jam computation, the durations vehicles are halting are collected. They are both collected over the whole time span a vehicle is on the detector area ("...HaltingDuration" and "haltingDurationSum"), and explicite for each interval ("...IntervalHaltingDuration" and "intervalHaltingDurationSum").
</p><p>The values are described in the following table.
