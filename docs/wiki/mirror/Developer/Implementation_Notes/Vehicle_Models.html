<p>Quite clumsy, you have to:
</p>
<ol><li>. define the Name of the XML-element in SUMOVehicleClass.h; you should look for other already existing definitions, such as "Krauss", or "IDM" and do what is done to them...
</li><li>. let the XML-parser know them by adding their mapping from name to int in SUMOXMLDefinitions.h and SUMOXMLDefinitions.cpp; look for SUMO_TAG_CF_KRAUSS for an example
</li><li>. Add them for being written when writing the vehicle type in SUMOVTypeParameter::write; again, you should look for an example like SUMO_TAG_CF_KRAUSS
</li><li>. Add a call to an attributes parsing method in SUMOVehicleParserHelper::parseVTypeEmbedded; the method should be named like "parseVTypeEmbedded_&lt;MODELNAME&gt;"
</li><li>. Implement this method; again, use a template...
</li></ol>
<p>Now the definitions are read and are also written, for example within routers. <b>Just as a hint:</b> probably, you should just look for a special car-following model which name is unique (such as IDM) and then redo everything for your model what was done here.

<ul><li> <font color="green">ok</font> Both the simulation and the routing modules must be able to parse vehicle type definitions
</li><li> It would be nice to allow a validation against XML Schemata

<a name="Loading_and_Parsing_Vehicle_Types" id="Loading_and_Parsing_Vehicle_Types"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Loading and Parsing Vehicle Types</span></h2>
<p>As already implemented for vehicles, a new intermediate structure <i><b>&lt;SUMO_HOME&gt;</b></i>/src/utils/common/SUMOVTypeParameter which contains vehicle type descriptions was added. When reading XML-definitions, both routers and the simulation use the additionally implemented helper methods located in <i><b>&lt;SUMO_HOME&gt;</b></i>/src/utils/xml/SUMOVehicleParserHelper for filling this structure.
</p><p>SUMOVTypeParameter has member variables for those vehicle type parameters which are assumed to be neither part of the car-following model nor part of the lane-change model: <i>id</i>, <i>length</i>, <i>maxSpeed</i>, <i>defaultProbability</i>, <i>speedFactor</i>, <i>speedDev</i>, <i>emissionClass</i>, <i>color</i>, <i>vehicleClass</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>offset</i>, <i>shape</i>. These values are initialised with defaults. When reading values, SUMOVehicleParserHelper stores the information about which value was set from the XML description in <i>SUMOVTypeParameter::setParameter</i>. This allows to save (pass) only set values when writing the definitions back to a file - routers need this.
</p><p>Parameters of the car-following model are saved into a map, <i>SUMOVTypeParameter::cfParameter</i>, the model's name to <i>SUMOVTypeParameter::cfModel</i>. Note that lane-changing model parameter handling is not implemented. The map contains only those parameter of the model which were given in the read XML file; no defaults are inserted at this time. In order to allow processing of old vtype-definitions, parameter stored directly within the vtype-element for the Krauss car-following model are stored within this map, too.
</p><p>The routers consume the SUMOVTypeParameter class directly - making ROVehicleType unnecessary. The simulation uses the new method MSVehicleType::build for building the described MSVehicleType/MSCFModel combination. Missing defaults are set within this method for obtaining complete vehicle type/model descriptions.

<a name="Step_1:_get_rid_of_critical.2Funcritical_move_methods" id="Step_1:_get_rid_of_critical.2Funcritical_move_methods"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Step 1: get rid of critical/uncritical move methods</span></h2>
<p><b>dkrajzew</b>: "Uncritical" vehicles are those which are not yet interacting with their next junctions. By now, they are moved as first - all lanes currently used by vehicles are visited, and the state (position and speed) of the last vehicle on the lane is saved. This is needed, because the lanes are always visited in random order, but the car-following model needs the speed/position of a leading car before it has been updated.
</p><p>Now, I would like to get rid of this first iteration over lanes. The reasons: a) the simulation should run faster, b) less code duplication.
</p><p>My intension is to save two last vehicle states. The first stores the state as it was before the lane was touched in the current step, the second after. In addition, the current simulation step is stored in the lane - as the "visiting" time of the last change.
</p><p>When asking for the state, the current simulation time is given. It is then easy to decide which of the stored values shall be used - the old one if the given time is larger than the visiting time. This change should make the "non-critical" methods obsolete.
</p><p><b>Tobias Mayer</b>:
this seems to be a reasonable step, but there will still be the need to distinguish between vehicles that interact with a junction and those that don't.

<p><b>dkrajzew</b>: By now, a vehicle is only positioned at the lane it's front is on. Several tweaks are done for determining how much the vehicle overlaps at the lane's begin. I would hope that saving the vehicle's first and last lane would reduce the computation done in moveCriticalCont and solve several issues - mainly within lane changing. In addition, it would allow a nicer visualisation.

<a name="Step_3.28.3F.29:_changing_the_right_of-way_rules" id="Step_3.28.3F.29:_changing_the_right_of-way_rules"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Step 3(?): changing the right of-way rules</span></h2>
<p><b>dkrajzew</b>: That's basically the main step towards moving to subseconds simulation. By now, vehicles are letting approached intersections know about their approach. Then, the intersections determine which vehicles may pass. Then the vehicles are moving over the intersection - if the intersection allowed them to do so.
</p><p>Now, the issue I have currently no solution for is as following: each vehicle must decide for each intersection it wants to pass whether it has to wait or not. In many cases, this depends on whether other vehicles approach this intersection or not. By now, this is solved as above. The reason for changing it is again two-fold: a) to speed-up the simulation, and b) for revisiting and more realistic behaviour on intersections.
</p><p>My initial idea would be to store each vehicle's arrival time and speed at the intersection. Then, a vehicle could ask whether vehicles with a higher right-of-way will pass the intersection in the next time or not. Still, I am not sure whether the random order of seeing the vehicles has any side-effects.
</p><p><b>Tobias Mayer</b>: I also think the decision about how to approach an intersection should be left to the vehicle/driver, with the intersection only handing out the "rules". Then, a vehicle can determine its own right-of-way. For speed reasons, that could be shared with all other interacting vehicles (best way would be to add it to each vehicle at the intersection's list, imho). About the randomness of vehicle registration: The right-of-way value should be computed without consideration of any other vehicle, and be an absolute numerical value. Of course those have to be calculated at every step, since changes in speed can not be known beforehand but will likely have an effect.
