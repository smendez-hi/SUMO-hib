<p>The most simple way to get own routes is to edit a routes file by hand, but only if the number of different routes is not too high. Before starting, it is important to know that a vehicle in SUMO consists of three parts: a vehicle type which describes the vehicle's physical properties, a route the vehicle shall take, and the vehicle itself. Both routes and vehicle types can be shared by several vehicles.

<p>At first a vehicle type will be defined:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;routes&gt;
    &lt;vType id=&quot;type1&quot; accel=&quot;0.8&quot; decel=&quot;4.5&quot; sigma=&quot;0.5&quot; length=&quot;5&quot; maxSpeed=&quot;70&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/routes&gt;
</pre>
<p>Having this defined, one can build vehicles of type "type1". The values used above are the ones most of the examples use. They resemble a standard vehicle as used within the Stefan Krauß' thesis.
</p><p>This definition is the initial one which includes both, the definition of the vehicle's "purely physical" parameters, such as its length, its color, or its max. velocity, and also the used car-following model's parameters. Please note that even though the car-following parameters are describing values such as max. acceleration, or max. deceleration, they mostly do not correspond to what one would assume. The maximum acceleration for example is not the car's maximum acceleration possibility but rather the maximum acceleration a driver choses - even if you have a Jaguar, you probably are not trying to go to 100km/h in 5s when driving through a city.
</p><p>For allowing to use different car-following models than the one developed by Krauß, the vehicle type definition was extended. The initial one still can be used, but an extension allows to additionally choose a different model and give its parameter. Here is how the new description looks like (for the same vehicle type as above):
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;routes&gt;
    &lt;vType id=&quot;type1&quot; length=&quot;5&quot; maxSpeed=&quot;70&quot;&gt;
        &lt;carFollowing-Krauss accel=&quot;0.8&quot; decel=&quot;4.5&quot; sigma=&quot;0.5&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/vType&gt;
&lt;/routes&gt;
</pre>
<p>You may note that the car-following model's parameter are now listed in a child-element of the vehicle type definition. Please note that the values of the <span class="inlxml">carFollowing</span>-element are overwriting values given in the <span class="inlxml">vType</span>-element.

Besides values which describe the vehicle's car-following properties, one can find definitions of the assigned vehicles' shapes, emissions, and assignment to abstract vehicle classes. These concepts will be described in the following. Also, you may find further descriptions of implemented car-following models in the subsection <a href="#Car-Following_Models" title="">#Car-Following Models</a>.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<a name="Vehicle_Length" id="Vehicle_Length"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Vehicle Length</span></h2>
<p>Due to the work on <a href="#Car-Following_Models" title="">car following models</a>, we decided to use two values for vehicle length. The <span class="inlxml">length</span>-attribute describes the length of the vehicle itself. Additionally, the <span class="inlxml">minGap</span>-attribute describes the offset to the leading vehicle when standing in a jam.
</p><p>This is illustrated in the following image:
</p><p><a href="images/Length_vs_minGap.svg" class="image" title="Length vs minGap.svg"><img alt="" src="images/Length_vs_minGap.svg" width="300" height="166" border="0" /></a>
</p><p>Within the simulation, each vehicle needs - when ignoring the safe gap - <span class="inlxml">length</span>+<span class="inlxml">minGap</span>. But only <span class="inlxml">length</span> of the road should be marked as being occupied.
</p>
<a name="Abstract_Vehicle_Class" id="Abstract_Vehicle_Class"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Abstract Vehicle Class</span></h2>
<p>A SUMO vehicle may be assigned to an "abstract vehicle class", defined by using the attribute <span class="inlxml">vClass</span>. These classes are used in lane definitions and allow/disallow the usage of lanes for certain vehicle types. One may think of having a road with three lanes, where the rightmost may only be used by "taxis" or "busses". The following vehicle classes exist:
</p>
<ul><li> "private"
</li><li> "public_transport"
</li><li> "public_emergency"
</li><li> "public_authority"
</li><li> "public_army"
</li><li> "vip"
</li><li> "ignoring"
</li><li> "passenger"
</li><li> "hov"
</li><li> "taxi"
</li><li> "bus"
</li><li> "delivery"
</li><li> "transport"
</li><li> "lightrail"
</li><li> "cityrail"
</li><li> "rail_slow"
</li><li> "rail_fast"
</li><li> "motorcycle"
</li><li> "bicycle"
</li><li> "pedestrian"
</li></ul>
<p>These values are a "best guess" of somehow meaningful values, surely worth to be discussed. Though, in parts, they represent classes found in imported formats. They are "abstract" in the means that they are just names only, one could build a .5m long bus. They are only used for determining the usability of lanes.
</p>
<a name="Vehicle_Emission_Classes" id="Vehicle_Emission_Classes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Vehicle Emission Classes</span></h2>
<p>The emission class represents a certain HBEFA-based emission class. It is defined using the <span class="inlxml">emissionClass</span> attribute.
</p>
<a name="Visualization" id="Visualization"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Visualization</span></h2>
<p>For a nicer visualization of the traffic, the appearence of a vehicle type's vehicles may be changed by assigning them a certain shape using the <span class="inlxml">guiShape</span> attribute. The following shapes are known:
</p>
<ul><li> "pedestrian"
</li><li> "bicycle"
</li><li> "motorcycle"
</li><li> "passenger"
</li><li> "passenger/sedan"
</li><li> "passenger/hatchback"
</li><li> "passenger/wagon"
</li><li> "passenger/van"
</li><li> "delivery"
</li><li> "transport"
</li><li> "transport/semitrailer"
</li><li> "transport/trailer"
</li><li> "bus"
</li><li> "bus/city"
</li><li> "bus/flexible"
</li><li> "bus/overland"
</li><li> "rail"
</li><li> "rail/light"
</li><li> "rail/city"
</li><li> "rail/slow"
</li><li> "rail/fast"
</li><li> "rail/cargo"
</li><li> "evehicle"
</li></ul>
<div style="background: #ffcc44; padding: .5em; border: 1px dashed #ff8800; margin-right:10px; margin-left:10px;"><b>Caution:</b><br />Not all of these named shapes are implemented.</div>
<p>In addition, one can determine the width of the vehicle using the attribute <span class="inlxml">guiWidth</span>.
</p><p>When using shapes, one should consider that different vehicle classes (passenger vehicles or buses) have different lengths. Passenger vehicles with more than 10m length look quite odd, buses with 2m length, too.

<p>As next, we will define a vehicle with a route owned by him only:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;routes&gt;
   &lt;vType id=&quot;type1&quot; accel=&quot;0.8&quot; decel=&quot;4.5&quot; sigma=&quot;0.5&quot; length=&quot;5&quot; maxSpeed=&quot;70&quot;/&gt;

   &lt;vehicle id=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;type1&quot; depart=&quot;0&quot; color=&quot;1,0,0&quot;&gt;
      &lt;route edges=&quot;beg middle end rend&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/vehicle&gt;

&lt;/routes&gt;
</pre>
<p>By giving such a route definition to <a href="SUMO.html" title="SUMO">SUMO</a> (or <a href="SUMO-GUI.html" title="SUMO-GUI">SUMO-GUI</a>), <a href="SUMO.html" title="SUMO">SUMO</a> will build a red (color=1,0,0) vehicle of type "type1" named "0" which starts at time 0. The vehicle will drive along the streets "beg", "middle", "end", and as soon as it has approached the edge "rend" it will be removed from the simulation. 
</p><p>This vehicle has an own, internal route which is not shared with other vehicles. It is also possible to define two vehicles using the same route. In this case the route must be "externalized" - defined before being referenced by the vehicles. Also, the route must be named by giving it an id. The vehicles using the route refer it using the "route"-attribute. The complete change looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="xml">

<p>There are a few important things to consider when building your own routes:
</p>
<ul><li> Routes have to be connected. At the moment the simulation does not raise an error if the next edge of the current route is not a successor of the current edge. The car will simply stop at the end of the current edge and will possibly be "teleported" to the next edge after a waiting time. This is very likely to change in future versions.
</li><li> Routes have to contain at least one edge.
</li><li> The starting edge has to be at least as long as the car starting on it. At the moment cars can only start at a position which makes them fit on the road completely.
</li><li> The route file has to be sorted by starting times. In fact this is only relevant, when you define a lot of routes or have large gaps between departure times. The simulation parameter --route-steps, which defaults to 200, defines the size of the time interval with which the simulation loads its routes. That means by default at startup only route with departure time &lt;200 are loaded, if all the vehicles have departed, the routes up to departure time 400 are loaded etc. pp. This works only if the route file is sorted. This behaviour may be disabled by specifying --route-steps 0.
</li></ul>
<p>The first three conditions can be checked using &lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;/tools/routecheck.py.

<a name="Route_and_vehicle_type_distributions" id="Route_and_vehicle_type_distributions"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Route and vehicle type distributions</span></h1>
<p>Instead of defining routes and vTypes explicitly for a vehicle <a href="SUMO.html" title="SUMO">SUMO</a> can choose them at runtime from a given distribution. In order to use this feature just define distributions as following:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;routes&gt;
    &lt;vTypeDistribution id=&quot;typedist1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;vType id=&quot;type1&quot; accel=&quot;0.8&quot; length=&quot;5&quot; maxSpeed=&quot;70&quot; probability=&quot;0.9&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;vType id=&quot;type2&quot; accel=&quot;1.8&quot; length=&quot;15&quot; maxSpeed=&quot;50&quot; probability=&quot;0.1&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/vTypeDistribution&gt;
&lt;/routes&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;routes&gt;
    &lt;routeDistribution id=&quot;routedist1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;route id=&quot;route0&quot; color=&quot;1,1,0&quot; edges=&quot;beg middle end rend&quot; probability=&quot;0.9&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;route id=&quot;route1&quot; color=&quot;1,2,0&quot; edges=&quot;beg middle end&quot; probability=&quot;0.1&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/routeDistribution&gt;
&lt;/routes&gt;
</pre>
<p>A distribution has only an id as (mandatory) attribute and needs a probability attribute for each of its child elements. The sum of the probability values needs not to be 1, they are scaled accordingly. At the moment the id for the childs is mandatory, this is likely to change in future versions.
</p><p>A distribution can be used just as using individual types and routes:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;routes&gt;
   &lt;vehicle id=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;typedist1&quot; route=&quot;routedist1&quot; depart=&quot;0&quot; color=&quot;1,0,0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/routes&gt;
</pre>
<a name="Stops" id="Stops"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Stops</span></h1>
<p>Vehicles may be forced to stop for a defined time span or wait for persons by using the stop element either as part of a route or a vehicle definition as following:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;routes&gt;
    &lt;route id=&quot;route0&quot; edges=&quot;beg middle end rend&quot;&gt;
        &lt;stop lane=&quot;middle_0&quot; endPos=&quot;50&quot; duration=&quot;20&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/route&gt;
    &lt;vehicle id=&quot;v0&quot; route=&quot;route0&quot; depart=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;stop lane=&quot;end_0&quot; endPos=&quot;10&quot; until=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/vehicle&gt;
&lt;/routes&gt;
</pre>
<p>The resulting vehicle will stop twice, once at lane middle_0 because of the stop defined in its route and the second time because of the stop
defined in the vehicle itself. The first stop will last 20 seconds the second one until simulation second 50. For a detailed list of attributes to stops see <a href="Specification.html#Stops" title="Specification">Specification#Stops</a>. For a description on how to use them to simulate public transport see <a href="Simulation/Public_Transport.html" title="Simulation/Public Transport">Simulation/Public Transport</a>.
