<p>Multi-Entry/Multi-Exit Detectors have to be defined within an additional file which has to be loaded by the simulation.
</p><p>The descriptions of Multi-Entry/Multi-Exit Detectors have to include the set of entry- and the set of exit-cross-sections. Due to this, it is not possible to use a single tag to specify a detector. Instead, the description consists of the following parts:
</p>
<ul><li> A beginning tag that describes some global attributes of the detector just as the descriptions of e1- and e2-detectors do. The format is: <span class="inlxml">&lt;entryExitDetector id="<i>&lt;ID&gt;</i>" file="<i>&lt;OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</i>" freq="<i>&lt;AGGREGATION_TIME&gt;</i>" [timeThreshold="<i>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</i>"] [speedThreshold="<i>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</i>"]&gt;</span>
</li><li> A set of tags that describe the detector's entry points in the form: <span class="inlxml">&lt;detEntry lane="<i>&lt;LANE_ID&gt;</i>" pos="<i>&lt;POSITION_ON_LANE&gt;</i>" [friendlyPos="x"]/&gt;</span>
</li><li> A set of tags that describe the detector's exit points in the form: <span class="inlxml">&lt;detExit lane="<i>&lt;LANE_ID&gt;</i>" pos="<i>&lt;POSITION_ON_LANE&gt;</i>" [friendlyPos="x"]/&gt;</span>
</li><li> A closing tag that must match the opening tag: <span class="inlxml">&lt;/entryExitDetector&gt;</span>
</li></ul>
<p>The definition
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;entryExitDetector id=&quot;e3_1&quot; freq=&quot;300&quot; file=&quot;./output/e3_1.xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;detEntry lane=&quot;myEdge0_0&quot; pos=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;detEntry lane=&quot;myEdge0_1&quot; pos=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;detExit lane=&quot;myEdge2_0&quot; pos=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;detExit lane=&quot;myEdge2_1&quot; pos=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/entryExitDetector&gt;
</pre>
<p>will build a Multi-Entry/Multi-Exit Detector starting at either lane 0 or 1 of the edge called "myEdge0" and end at the same lane of "myEdge2". All values will be computed as the default-value for measures is used and aggregated over a time of 300s. They will be written into the file "e3_1.xml" lying in the subfolder of the folder the configuration was read in/the program has been started within.

<p>A single data line within the output of a simulated Multi-Entry/Multi-Exit Detector looks as following:<span class="inlxml">&lt;interval begin="<i>&lt;BEGIN_TIME&gt;</i>" end="<i>&lt;END_TIME&gt;</i>" id="<i>&lt;ID&gt;</i>" meanTravelTime="<i>&lt;MEAN_TT&gt;</i>" meanSpeed="<i>&lt;MEAN_SPEED&gt;</i>" meanHaltsPerVehicle="<i>&lt;MEAN_HALT_NUMBER&gt;</i>" vehicleSum="<i>&lt;#VEHICLES&gt;</i>" meanSpeedWithin="<i>&lt;MEAN_SPEED&gt;</i>" meanHaltsPerVehicleWithin="<i>&lt;MEAN_HALT_NUMBER&gt;</i>" meanDurationWithin="<i>&lt;MEAN_HALT_DURATION&gt;</i>" vehicleSumWithin="<i>&lt;#VEHICLES&gt;</i>" meanIntervalSpeedWithin="<i>&lt;MEAN_SPEED&gt;</i>" meanIntervalHaltsPerVehicleWithin="<i>&lt;MEAN_HALT_NUMBER&gt;</i>" meanIntervalDurationWithin="<i>&lt;MEAN_HALT_DURATION&gt;</i>"/&gt;</span>
</p><p>As for lane area detectors, the measures generated by Multi-Entry/Multi-Exit Detector may be grouped by the way they are computed. The plain measures take only those vehicles into account that have left the detector area within the described interval. Additionally, measures of the vehicles that are still inside the area are generated (postfix "Within"), containing both measures valid for the whole ride through the area and measures made up of only those samples that were collected within the current interval ("...Interval..."). The value are described one by one in the following table.
