			<p>This output contains the simulation-wide number of vehicles that are loaded, emitted, running, waiting to be inserted, have reached their destination and how long they needed to finish the route. The last value is normalised over all vehicles that have reached their destination so far.

<p>You can force the simulation to generate this output using <span style="color: #111144; font-weight: bold; white-space: pre;">--summary <a href="../../Basics/Notation.html#Referenced_Data_Types" title="Basics/Notation"><i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i></a></span>. 
</p>
<a name="Generated_Output" id="Generated_Output"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Generated Output</span></h2>
<p>The information containing all those values is computed for each time step and the output file looks like following:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;summary&gt;
   &lt;step time=&quot;&lt;SIMULATION_TIME&gt;&quot; \
              loaded=&quot;&lt;LOADED_VEHICLE_NUMBER&gt;&quot; \
              emitted=&quot;&lt;EMITTED_VEHICLE_NUMBER&gt;&quot; \
              running=&quot;&lt;RUNNING_VEHICLE_NUMBER&gt;&quot; \
              waiting=&quot;&lt;NUMBER_OF_VEHICLES_WAITING_FOR_EMISSION&gt;&quot; \
              ended=&quot;&lt;ENDED_VEHICLE_NUMBER&gt;&quot; \
              meanWaitingTime=&quot;&lt;MEAN_WAITING_TIME&gt;&quot; \
              meanTravelTime=&quot;&lt;MEAN_TRAVEL_TIME&gt;&quot;/&gt;

   ... further time steps ...

&lt;/summary&gt;
</pre>
<p>Please note, that in contrary to the example above, for each time step, all those values are reported in one line. A description of the values is given in the table below.
