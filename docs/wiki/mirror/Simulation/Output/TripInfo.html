<p>The simulation is forced to generate this output using the option <span style="color: #111144; font-weight: bold; white-space: pre;">--tripinfo-output <a href="../../Basics/Notation.html#Referenced_Data_Types" title="Basics/Notation"><i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i></a></span> or  <span style="color: #111144; font-weight: bold; white-space: pre;">--tripinfo <a href="../../Basics/Notation.html#Referenced_Data_Types" title="Basics/Notation"><i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i></a></span> on the command line/within a configuration. This output contains the information about each vehicle's departure time, the time the vehicle wanted to start at (which may be lower than the real departure time) and the time the vehicle has arrived. The information is generated for each vehicle as soon as the vehicle arrived at its destination and is removed from the network.

<a name="Generated_Output" id="Generated_Output"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Generated Output</span></h2>
<p>The format is as following:

<p>Please note that, in contrary to the example above, for each time step, all those values are reported in one line. An entry is written each time a vehicle has arrived at his destination. In prior to this, the written values would not be known.
