			<p>There are two main scripts responsible for the nightly build process which are tools/build/dailyUpdateMakeGCC (for the linux part) and tools/build/dailyBuildMSVC.py for windows. Essentially they both perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol><li> svn update (if no changes occured, the script ends)
</li><li> do a clean build (release and debug version)
</li><li> run unittests (currently linux only)
</li><li> build and upload packages
</li><li> build and upload documentation (linux only)
</li><li> run the acceptance tests (texttest)
</li><li> upload test results
</li></ol>
<p>All the results can be found in the <a href="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/daily/" class="external text" title="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/daily/" rel="nofollow">daily dir on the sumo web space</a>, also see <a href="../Downloads.html#Nightly_Snapshots" title="Downloads">Downloads#Nightly_Snapshots</a>.
The binaries and the packages (but no test results) are also in the Daten/Sumo/Nightly directory on the DLR internal vm_tausch. The windows script uses the source and the doc package from the vm_tausch to build the binary distributable zip.
</p><p>One final step is to trigger the nightly build on the opensuse build service. This is achieved via uploading a new spec file via tools/build/buildServiceUpload.sh, which triggers an automatic download of the sources and a rebuild. All errors and test result e-mails are directed to the sumo-tests list at dlr.de, except for the build service errors which go to a private account since the build is currently in a private project.
