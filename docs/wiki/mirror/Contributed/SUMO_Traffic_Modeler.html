			<p>SUMO Traffic Modeler by Leontios Papaleontiou is a graphical application for setting up an activity-based demand. It is not longer developed by the original author, and as it has some interesting features, we included it into the release.
</p><p>The tool is stored in a runnable .jar-file, you may simply double-click on it on Windows to start it - it requires Java 6 to be installed. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sumo/index.php?title=SUMO_Traffic_Modeler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="SUMO Traffic Modeler (page does not exist)">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> is located in <i><b>&lt;SUMO_HOME&gt;</b></i>\bin.
</p><p>There is not much documentation on it. What worked for me was:
</p>
<ul><li> on the command line
<ul><li> having a given road network, reimport it using <a href="../NETCONVERT.html" title="NETCONVERT">NETCONVERT</a> and save plain XML definitions using the <span style="color: #111144; font-weight: bold; white-space: pre;">--plain-output</span> option. Make sure the prefix of the plain files is the same as the network's name.
</li></ul>
</li><li> start the SUMO Traffic Modeler by double-clicking on it
</li><li> generate a project
<ul><li> choose File-&gt;New Project...
</li><li> navigate to the folder the network/plain network definitions are located in for both, the project's name and for the network description
</li><li> the network should appear
</li></ul>
</li><li> set-up demand
<ul><li> click on "Traffic Layers" in the tree located on the right side of the window
</li><li> add some demand definitions ("Flow", "Area Flow", "Hotspot")
</li><li> you may alter the demands using the dialog on the right, bottom side of the window
</li></ul>
</li><li> export the demand/simulation
<ul><li> choose Simulation-&gt;Export...
</li><li> fill the dialog with some meaningful values
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>What you will obtain after those steps is a simulation configuration file. The files referenced within this configuration are not yet build. Even though <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sumo/index.php?title=SUMO_Traffic_Modeler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="SUMO Traffic Modeler (page does not exist)">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> has a menu for setting up the paths to <a href="../NETCONVERT.html" title="NETCONVERT">NETCONVERT</a> and <a href="../DUAROUTER.html" title="DUAROUTER">DUAROUTER</a>, both application are not executed automatically. Instead, you have to convert the trips generated by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sumo/index.php?title=SUMO_Traffic_Modeler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="SUMO Traffic Modeler (page does not exist)">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> into routes by yourself on the command line. You may reuse the network you have used to set up <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sumo/index.php?title=SUMO_Traffic_Modeler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="SUMO Traffic Modeler (page does not exist)">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a>, but you probably have to build it using the given edges/nodes files if you have pruned it during the work with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sumo/index.php?title=SUMO_Traffic_Modeler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="SUMO Traffic Modeler (page does not exist)">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a>.
</p><p>If you convert the trips generated by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sumo/index.php?title=SUMO_Traffic_Modeler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="SUMO Traffic Modeler (page does not exist)">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> into routes using <a href="../DUAROUTER.html" title="DUAROUTER">DUAROUTER</a>, you may get the error "No connection between '...' and '...' found.". To ignore it, call <a href="../DUAROUTER.html" title="DUAROUTER">DUAROUTER</a> with <span style="color: #111144; font-weight: bold; white-space: pre;">--ignore-errors</span>.
